# larTPC-michel-direction-dsnt-supernova-pointing
This is a repo for a multi-view neural network for Michel electron and eES supernova head-tail disambiguation in liquid argon TPCs. It uses DSNT heatmap regression with physics-informed bremsstrahlung losses and cross-view geometric consistency to predict Michel (eES) electron direction to allow for supernova neutrino pointing for DUNE.

Uses ICEBERG test-stand data with stopping muons (Michel electrons), and is directly applicable to other LArTPCs, including DUNE Far Detector supernova neutrino–electron elastic-scattering events.
