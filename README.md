# larTPC-michel-direction-dsnt-supernova-pointing
This is a repo for a multi-view neural network for Michel electron and eES supernova head-tail disambiguation in liquid argon TPCs. It uses DSNT heatmap regression with physics-informed bremsstrahlung losses and cross-view geometric consistency to predict Michel (eES) electron direction, enabling supernova neutrino pointing for DUNE.
